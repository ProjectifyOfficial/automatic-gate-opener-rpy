# Automatic Gate Opener rpy

If you are tired to spend a lot of money in automatic gate controller this project can help you!

**Automatic Gate Opener rpy** is a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) solution to control an automatic gate by a mobile phone using a broken automatic gate controller.

## Requirements
* [Raspberry PI](https://www.raspberrypi.org/): Python framework for Telegram 
* [Relay](https://www.amazon.com/SainSmart-101-70-101-4-Channel-Relay-Module/dp/B0057OC5O8): a Relay
* [broken automatic gate controller]()
* [cables]()
* [Tin welder](https://www.google.it/search?q=welding+machine+electronic&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwikmb2M4fTUAhUhIcAKHQDrC-sQ_AUIBigB&biw=1855&bih=966#tbm=isch&q=Tin+welder)

## Circuit Installation

take your broken automatic gate controller and try to close the circuit with a cable. When you found the correct pins weld to each of them a cable and after that follow the images in this [images]()


## SW Installation

go in your raspberry pi and paste the following commands: 

update the package lists for upgrades for packages that need upgrading

```
sudo apt-get update
```
fetch new versions of packages existing on the machine if APT knows about these new versions

```
sudo apt-get upgrade
```
install all necessary library

```
sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev libconfig-dev libssl-dev lua5.2 liblua5.2-dev libevent-dev make libjansson-dev
```

copy the Command-line interface for Telegram in the directory where you want install it

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/vysheng/tg.git 
```

go in the tg folder, configure all and enter into installation of de Telegram cli

```
cd tg
sudo ./configure
sudo make
```
enter into the guided installation

```
./bin/telegram-cli
```

now enter the mobile phone number with the prefix of your country, your name and surname of the people who are allowed to control the gate with the following command

```
add_contact [countryPrefix_phone_number] [name] [surname]
ex: add_contact 39xxxxxxxxx Alan Turing
```	
at this point add the code prvided by BotFather into the array **id_a** and run the **telegram_server.py** using this command
 ```
python telegram_server.py
```	
now chat with your bot using this command on your telegram app and  the gate will start to opening
 ```
/toggle
```

**note:**if you are using an ssh connection you can keep alive the session using a tool like [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)

## Structure
* [remote_controller.py](https://github.com/sdrabb/automatic-gate-opener-rpy/blob/master/remote_controller.py): contains all the procedures used to control the circuit that open and close the gate
* [telegram_server.py](https://github.com/sdrabb/automatic-gate-opener-rpy/blob/master/telegram_server.py): telegram server implementation

## Build with
* [telepot](https://github.com/nickoala/telepot/): Python framework for Telegram
